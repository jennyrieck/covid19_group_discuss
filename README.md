# Covid19 Vulnerable Populations Group Discussions
Analyses of the [Toronto Office of Recovery and Rebuild Group Discussion data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-office-of-recovery-and-rebuild-group-discussion-vulnerable-populations/) available through [Open Data Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/)

## Dataset
From June 24 to July 24, 2020, the City of Toronto contracted Social Planning Toronto (a local non-governmental organization) to conduct additional outreach to equity-seeking or vulnerable residents and groups on their ideas and priorities for response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This data set contains the responses (in group discussions) to an online and phone survey conducted as part of this outreach.

## Project Aims:
* How do different vulnerable populations in Toronto describe how they have been affected by COVID-19?
* What supports do different vulnerable populations need?
