11847967314,22,n/a,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,"On a positive note, I had more access to virtual meetings because face to face meetings were avoided due to the need for social distancing - I found that Restrictive Visitors Policies in Long Term Care and Hospital Admissions to be a huge problem. I had a serious and sudden health issue and add emergency they wanted me to be admitted. I ended up leaving against medical advice because my attendant nor my husband was allowed to be on the ward with me. - Like many people, I had a lot of problems getting access to hand sanitizer and personal   protective equipment (PPE) for people with disabilities & personal support workers (PSWS) - We are at risk of losing personal care support from family, friends, neighbours, or a community agency due to physical distancing requirements.   ","Reliable and safe transit. I did not like the fact that Wheel-Trans with screening requests for rides. Because you had to speak to a reservation is in person, I anticipated very long waits on the telephone. I have not used Wheel-Trans at all during COVID-1. - Access to libraries and library services - I really appreciated that they allow people to borrow books online, even if they did not own a library card. I really appreciated that that came about early on. - Technology support to access virtual programs and services (e.g. internet access, devices) is   very important to enable people to stay connected. In my case, going to places in person is becoming very difficult. If I am taking Wheel-Trans, I have to allow two hours each way plus the time needed to be at the event. There are limits to how many DF hours I can use for this purpose. Plus, at the event there might not be a washroom big enough for me and my attendant to fit into at the same time. The accessible cubicles in a multi-stall washroom are not big enough for me. I need the large, multi-gender type washroom. I would much rather do a virtual meeting, even after the pandemic crisis has passed.   ","There needs to be a campaign to encourage people to use and dispose of masks correctly. If they came up with something cute or humorous, I think people would pay more attention to it. People are zoning out when they hear reminders about washing hands, etc. The city could do something that’s fresh and engaging. - Wheel-Trans needs to communicate what their hygiene procedures are. They currently cannot guarantee that you would have a ride by yourself and therefore you might be in proximity to someone else. I have not used Wheel-Trans during the pandemic primarily for that reason. At your consultation session, someone said that you do get a ride by yourself. This was news to me but perhaps it’s because that person is on ACAT. I worry that Wheel-Trans operators won’t use their PPE properly – e.g., using the same gloves from person to person without changing them, not using their mask properly, removing it, etc. when needed. I think that Wheel-Trans drivers should be issued some masks with the transparent panel at the front that they could use when they are informed that they are picking up a passenger who is deaf or hard of hearing. - I think I would need help with regard to hiring attendants on DF. Half of my people decided to self-isolate or otherwise not come back so I have been utilizing my current staff to the limit. I think CILT‘s CARS roster has enormous potential to match people up. I would suggest getting some funding so the staff could be interviewed to be part of CARS and then be required to update their availability each month in order to stay on the roster. DF managers should be required to update their information annually in order to stay on the roster. It may also be helpful to have a way to reach into community colleges and other private schools who train PSWs to let them know about Direct Funding and to people on the rosters as well.   ","I would like to see virtual meetings continue past COVID-1. The meeting doesn’t have to be 10% virtual – it could also allow for people to attend in person or by teleconference. The city should use a service like Zoom rather than WebEx because WebEx has a lot of accessibility problems. Perhaps the city could do their own test comparison with actual people disabilities to see which think works better and/or connect with other municipalities who might have already done this.      I think this is important: the city is creating barriers to people with disabilities and treating us like second-class citizens. Forty years ago, if I want to go to a movie I had to go into a back alley past rows of garbage, and my friend would have to go into the front door and get an usher to open the back door from inside so I can go in. With better accessibility guidelines coming in place, we are finally able to go on the front door of public buildings, malls and many restaurants and other venues. However, the city is regressing back to this back-door policy for people with disabilities. For example, Wheel-Trans was forced to change their drop off and pick up points at Toronto Rehab from the front door to a side door near a bus stop which means a longer walk - difficult in bad weather and also no line of sight between the clinic waiting room and the vehicle. I have to go back and forth and in- and outside of the building repeatedly to ensure I don’t miss my ride. At City Hall itself, there is no easy way to access the front entrance of the building. It involves a long walk in from the bus stop on Bay Street. Recently the accessible entrance on Hagerman Street was closed to people with disabilities who had a dedicated place to wait for Wheel-Trans that was heated and had a telephone in case the ride was delayed. This needs to be addressed   - Fran’s restaurant on College Street renovated its front entrance which had a nine-inch step in front of it. I was excited to think that after years of working in this location, I’d be able to access this popular site for my lunch breaks. However, after the renovation, I just found a new step in place of the old one. There was lots of room to make a sloped entrance, but designers did not take accessibility into account, and the City didn’t bother to exercise its authority. The city needs to use its power to withhold building permits unless the building plan includes a plan for accessibility. This was not done and could have been done very easily.   ","Affordable housing RGI and 10% accessible housing to close the gap created over decades. The city has an opportunity to do this with new requests for permits to erect apartment buildings and condos. 10% accessible doesn’t mean that ONLY people disabilities could live there, it just means that whenever there is a vacancy if there is a person with a disability looking for a place to live, they would have the option for that unit, because all units would be accessible. People with disabilities would not have to wait until an accessible became available, because all units would be accessible. With only 1 to 1% of unit being accessible, it could take decades before an accessible unit happened to be available.  A huge “hot spot” under COVID-1 was the overcrowded conditions for people who are   experiencing homelessness. They are kept in unsanitary hostels and temporary residences. Yet all of a sudden, after COVID-1, we had all kinds of options: hotels and other places available for people. These private residences have to be made available on a permanent basis. Working with the province if possible, the city must provide permanent residences for people who find themselves experiencing homelessness for whatever reason. They could repurpose hotels or student residences. Many units can be freed up in a variety of buildings. I don’t recommend putting everyone who was formerly homeless in one building. When there is a mix of populations in the neighbourhood, things work out better, so I would propose freeing up housing and making sure it has a sufficient mix. - Transportation is a big issue for the city. The city must make it affordable, reliable and   enjoyable! – Why not have a contest to come up with fun ideas? Emphasize the FUN in functional.   ","Help to incubate entrepreneurial business – AccessNow is a great success story – AccessNow was big help during COVID by creating a listing of businesses that come to your home to deliver groceries, provide entertainment, etc. People with disabilities could be provided training and support in a think tank kind of environment that helps people get their idea launched an out there. - The city itself could target hiring people disabilities and support hiring with centralized accommodation fund. A centralized accommodation fund would mean the cost of an interpreter or an attendant for an employee with a disability would be absorbed across the city’s budget as a whole – not within one small department. - The city could create and promote virtual jobs that can be done remotely. This could be   any number of creative jobs and technical jobs like websites design and testing. Many sectors have found that employees are working quite well virtually, and his presents new opportunities for something will disabilities. The city could use a total revamp of its website – it is very hard to find information if you don’t know exact name of committee, service, initiative etc. that you are looking for. Their website needs to think about what people are looking for when they go to the city’s page and to be intuitive about what to our residents are looking for when they go to webpage. - For example, I was looking for the video record of the City’s Accessibility Advisory Committee, and I had a very hard time finding it.   ","An Online Q and A on the city’s website would be helpful. Not just a long FAQ, but something dynamic and interactive. - Introduce a live “May I help you?” feature when visiting the website to direct people to what they want - As mentioned earlier, hold meetings with an accessible format like Zoom; when meetings are live again, continue to allow a Zoom option so that more people can participate – not just as passive absorbers but also as presenters, members and debutants   ",,"Citizens With Disabilities – Ontario held two held virtual chats with people with disabilities to share information at the national, provincial and municipal level relating to COVID-1, program and services available, and to offer a chance for peer support. Over this case, we have found that the best advice for people disabilities has come from people with disabilities themselves! - Citizens With Disabilities - Ontario created and posted two “Living Documents” which are   updated as new material is available:   COVID Guide for people with disabilities can be found on our website at www.cwdo.org   Toronto Guide for the “newly disabled” – this document predates COVID-1, but we have received positive comments about it – even from people who have been living with a disability for a long time. This can also be found on our website at www.cwdo.org","The city can learn from people with disabilities. For example, we have learned how to meet remotely; how to get supplies delivered at home. - Ensure that slide walks don’t get cluttered – leave room for people in wheelchairs to pass by. This is becoming more of an issue because sidewalk patios need to space out seating to ensure there is social distancing, but this is also narrowing the pathway for people who use mobility devices and putting things unexpectedly into a travel path where someone with a visual impairment might trip over it and injure themselves. - Use your authority when issuing building permits to withhold them if the building plan is perpetuating or creating accessibility barriers – e.g., as mentioned above with Fran’s Restaurant on College street. Similarly, the city can withhold a building permit for new apartments or condominiums that won’t have 10% accessibility. Yes, a few builders might decide to do business with another municipality, but most of them are attracted to Toronto and want to do their business here. If the city holds firm to accessibility principles, they will do a great thing for people with disabilities in the city and also for people who will continue to live in the city as they get older and need accessibility and accommodations.

11839384180,10,M6K,,,1,1,1,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,"The following consultation was hosted with a group of Filipinx community members in Parkdale. The core themes they identified are:     Contracted COVID-1: One of the respondents contracted COVID-1 on May **, and expressed that she almost died. 1 days into her illness, her daughter was tested positive. The family is still positive for COVID-1.      Friend or family contracted COVID-1: One man’s wife and family friends had been diagnosed with COVID 1, which impacted his mental health.    Lost employment or income: Most people were working and were able to pay their rent before the pandemic, but after COVID-1 they were laid off or their hours were significantly reduced (e.g. cut from 1 hours to 1 hours per week) so they had to turn to other sources to get food and pay their rent. Some people noted that they were living paycheck to paycheck before the pandemic hit, and are now dependent on CERB to cover rent and bills but have no room for other expenses such as food.     Required to work longer hours: One person who worked from home for a Financial Investment Company during COVID-1 noted that their work hours are longer and that they’re required to work more. They noted that it is not a healthy environment working from home all the time, because they work and sleep in the same room. As a result they feel anxious and are affected physically and mentally.     Felt sad, anxious, overwhelmed, or lonely: People were worried about their rent, job, food, friends, family members, and people back home in the Philippines and they became overwhelmed and anxious. Several people noted that this experience led to significant mental health challenges, such as depression, and physical health challenges, such as dental conditions that are worsened by stress.    Had to visit a food bank or access food programs: Several of the participants were grateful for their community and groups like PARC and Mutual Aid Parkdale to support them with accessing food.    Other - Impact on Studies: A student noted that online courses will have a significant impact on their studies. ","Access to recreational facilities or programming:  People used to access recreational facilities in the neighbourhood before they shut down.     Space for people to meet safely in communities or to deliver important community programs and services in person or virtually: Before the Pandemic, community members would see each other and take care of each other. But during the pandemic, they couldn’t see each other and needed to access support from others.    Skills training and employment supports: One of the youth relied on skills training and employment support from his school, but since the pandemic hit all of the job fairs and seminars were postponed.  Until now, youth are waiting for these opportunities from their schools.","Food banks and other food security programs: Participants shared that free food programs will be a necessary urgent support because employers are scheduling shorter shifts, and income will be less because of reduced hours and family members being laid off. Several participants noted that they had never accessed a food bank until the pandemic hit. One person said that they would like to have a neighborhood pantry where people could bring food and other people can take food.    Skills training and employment support: Many people have lost their job, so they would like the opportunity to gain different employment skills and participate in job fairs where they can access employment opportunities where you can work from home for safety purposes. People want the government to invest in entrepreneurship programs so people can open their own businesses.    Mental health supports and/or supports to address social isolation: Participants shared we need to focus on mental health programs to support people who are experiencing anxiety, depression, and heightened mental health challenges that also impact physical health.     No COVID-1 Evictions: One participant noted that for the next six months, tenants urgently need support. You feel free, safe, and stable in your building when you know that you will not get evicted if you miss a month of your rent.  One participant suggested installment plans during COVID-1, in small amounts not in full amounts by working with the landlord.  Another participant shared that their landlord waived their rent for two months because they were COVID-positive, and suggested that more people should be eligible for waiving their rent during the pandemic.   ","Increased Visibility and Support for Community Organizations: Several participants shared that before COVID-1, they did not know that Parkdale Activity-Recreation Centre (PARC) existed. Only during the pandemic they learned that there is a group of people at PARC who work with the community and what to do the best for the community. They believe that the government can better support this kind of organization and help make it more visible. They suggested more flyers, social media advertisements, open houses, and translated materials in Tagalog.    Local Food Security Initiatives: The government can support food security initiatives by directing supermarkets to install containers to collect donations for local initiatives, such as PARC and Mutual Aid Parkdale, to re-distribute to those in need. Instead of giving donations to **, we should have donations stay in Parkdale. If we collect food from No Frills and larger food chains, we can designate the donations for an area in South Parkdale and there can be a schedule for drop offs.    Sanitation: During COVID-1, the TTC has improved their practice of cleaning the subway, streetcars, and buses.  After the recovery, they should continue to clean these spaces.  Prior to COVID-1, it felt unclean and unsanitary.  ","1. Rent control (1): Rent is too high in Parkdale and we need programs like rent control. Many people are homeless because they couldn’t pay their rent. We need people to advocate for the homeless. The City needs to build housing for low income and marginalized people.     2. Healthcare (1): The group advocated for accessible and affordable healthcare, not only for COVID-1 but other health situations so they can easily access laboratories, doctor consultations, and medicine. We also need public health education about how to control the spread of this virus.     1. Employment (1): We need the government and organizations to help people get access to employment and job training programs.","Small Business Loans: Many small businesses have closed, so the government should extend the time to help them.  Businesses need capital, and once they open again they will have income and create jobs.     Online Job Fairs: Local governments need to contact local companies and create online job fairs. One participant shared that 1% of companies do not operate online, so the government needs to reach out to them and collaborate to create jobs that are accessible for people to apply online. The City, small businesses, local organizations, and local residents could gather online or in person to collaborate and support people to participate in job creation, training and employment.    Support Small Local Businesses: Communities need to purchase local products to support small businesses.    Create Jobs and Entrepreneurial Supports: Create employment opportunities in emergent industries, such as Personal Protective Equipment which is in high demand. Likewise, people shared the opportunity for people to prepare cooked meals or share their cooking skills with people who do not know how to cook, which could be promoted at local farmers markets. People have many skills (e.g. cooking, baking, cutting hair) which could be converted into an entrepreneurial opportunity.  ","The group recognized that marginalized groups are systematically not heard by the City of Toronto, drawing examples from the Black Lives Matter movement and the emergence of encampments across the City (Queen and Dufferin, Bathurst and Dundas, Trinity Bellwoods). They noted that for people who do not have access to the internet, engagement is incredibly difficult, and therefore the City needs to build engagement plans that involve in-person action centres or over the phone support for people to share their concerns and ideas. They also called for community organizations to better support and include marginalized groups, noting that “these people are begging for change and most need help.” When reflecting on the housing crisis, they also noted that shelters are full and therefore the City needs to prioritize building more shelters and permanent affordable housing instead of people squatting and being exposed to the spread of the virus. We need to prioritize homeless community members in the decision making processes of the City and give them shelter support so that they can live in a decent home and control the spread of the virus. ","We need to follow community and youth leaders to help advance their visions for the future, such as the following climate change initiatives:    Affordable or free transit: The group unanimously agreed that the City needs to lower the fare for TTC to encourage people to use public transit - the fares are currently too expensive.    Waste reduction: The group discussed waste reduction, and gave the specific example of promoting reusable masks to limit littering and create entrepreneurial opportunities for local sewers to make masks.     Community gardens: The group discussed the benefits of community gardens where you can plant vegetables, fruits, and trees and then sell the produce in local markets. They noted that gardening is a healthy activity that can reduce stress and help with mental health.    Limit plastics: The group noted that we need to use less plastic because it is really bad for the environment. They shared that big things start with small beginnings.     Active transportation: The group encourages the use of e-bikes to limit the amount of car usage, and provided the example of e-bikes on Tyndall. They also suggested making it a law.  ","The group gave the example of Mutual Aid Parkdale, who have been providing free food to community members during the pandemic. ","Questions about the COVID-1 Vaccine: The group had a series of questions about the accessibility of the vaccine once it is ready, and the government’s plan for the rest of the year: What will the government do after the 1 months? If they have the vaccine, will it be free and accessible to everyone? If I have immunity in my body do I need to get the vaccine? How accurate will it be that you don’t get the virus.  Will you get COVID like you do with the flu when you get the flu virus.      COVID-1 Protocols: People in power need to take a firm position and take clear leadership.  We can not relax our public health protocols.  The protocols we have been facing should be extended.  We need the media to share the message of how important these protocols are.    Social Responsibilities: We need to educate people about their social responsibility to each other. I will feel safe when I am in a community that respects everyone. Everyone should be responsible - if we have symptoms of COVID-1, we need to cooperate with the local community and government so we can control the virus and trace it.  Contact tracing is very important, but people are hesitant to report themselves for fear that they will be discriminated against.      Housing as Safety: Housing is a part of safety - if you don’t have housing, you’re not safe.     c",,,,,
11839342488,9,M6K,,,1,,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,"The following consultation was hosted with a group of Tamil community members in Parkdale. The core themes they identified are:     Struggled to pay rent: Two respondents noted that they struggled to pay rent. One noted that they managed their rent after the CERB payments came, and one noted that she struggled while living in a 1 bedroom house with her daughter and husband and faced a lot of stress while having to stay home for long periods of time.    Required to work longer hours: Two of the respondents experienced increased stress and anxiety working frontline as essential workers. One working mother noted that she felt stressed that she may catch COVID-1 and pass it to her kids from work. One frontline worker noted the following:     “I was not really “affected” per say by the COVID-1 pandemic as I was continuing to go to work as I worked in a grocery store and I was an essential worker. Nonetheless, I had a lot of doubts as to whether I should go to work and there was a lot of stress. I live in an apartment and if this virus were to hit us, it would be difficult to safely social-distance and so there would be a lot of difficulty staying safe. Even between getting tested, the time it takes for results is quite long and we are forced to return home unsure of whether we are infected. The government has done a good job helping with CERB but with issues of social distancing, we need to continue to keep people apart and so people can do their jobs and keep everyone safe.”    Friend or family contracted COVID-1: Two respondents had friends, family members and neighbours contracted COVID-1. One respondent noted that some tenants in her building got COVID-1 and the building management team made sure to clean up the common areas. For a short period, she was unable to leave her unit and now has some mild fear of leaving home, but she is doing okay now. Another respondent expressed deep sadness about friends and distant relatives who contracted COVID-1. As a result, the respondent’s family were very scared to go outside, even to the grocery stores. They put trust in God and were hopeful that we will overcome this pandemic and be safe as a community soon.     Other - Challenges faced by seniors: One respondent shared that many seniors they knew had issues getting adequate groceries. Another respondent expressed sadness that they were unable to visit their mother who is elderly and living with their brother.    Lost employment or income: One respondent noted that COVID-1 affected their family because they lost one job. ","Most respondents noted that they did not receive supports before COVID-1. One participant attended ESL classes offered by the City of Toronto, and one participant received support with old age security and benefits before COVID-1. ","Reliable and safe transit: Four respondents advocated for the need for stronger social distancing measures on public transit, and the need for TTC to create a better system for patrons to get on and off safely.    School Reopening and Safety: Four respondents advocated for the safe reopening of schools to provide better learning environments and social structures for children. Several parents shared challenges with online learning, while also recognizing the need for regulations and precautions if schools were to reopen safely. One respondent shared the following recommendations:     “We need to help children going back to school, especially considering how they were inside their rooms and homes sitting in front of screens for hours and so their mental health is affected. We need many precautions in place before allowing children to go to school. The question of online learning is important as many kids are unable to learn in front of a screen and they need one-to-one education help so children will be successful. With in-person school, we need better safety measures but it needs to be done so school is accessible for everyone. Children are affected a lot by this pandemic and so we need to help them. Having online learning is difficult because children are unable to learn on their own at home. We must revise the online school/in-person school aspect and try our best to accommodate everyone’s needs but keep safety and health concerns in mind.”    Health Services and Public Education: Four respondents also called for expanded health services (such as extended hours at medical facilities for check-ins and blood tests) and opportunities for public education around disease spread. One respondent shared the following:     “The City needs to educate the people and teach them about the virus spread especially now as people are going out to restaurants more as the city is reopening. They should inform everyone in an accessible way such as different language support for different communities so everyone knows how serious the situation is. The idea of giving fines is good so people will follow bylaws such as wearing masks in public indoor places. Many people do not follow the 2M distancing guideline and so we need masks. I like this enforcement. Temperature checks need to be more widespread, we need these everywhere.”    Other concerns: Respondents also advocated for income supports spanning beyond the summer; access to libraries and library services; food security programs; employment supports; and concerns around increased substance use and homelessness.","Supports for the Tamil Community: The majority of the respondents described in depth the need for culturally-relevant supports for the Tamil community in Parkdale. Several respondents noted West Neighbourhood House (formerly known as St. Christopher House) had a social worker ** who used to support the Tamil community with resources, translation, and advocacy. Since the closure of the office, respondents noted that the Tamil community has been struggling to find help and advocated for a Tamil community support worker in Parkdale (or at least a Tamil interpreter). The group noted that they need community partners who can support them and the City to fund partners to support different cultural groups experiencing barriers to culturally-relevant services. For example, one respondent shared the following insights about the intersections of employment barriers with mental health, substance use, and policing in the Tamil community:      “I have a question for the Tamil community: there is a huge language problem and this impacts people finding jobs and makes them depend on welfare for a long time. We need some sort of job agencies for people with language barriers so they can be less dependent on welfare and social assistance. Many families face issues due to financial reasons and not being able to find jobs. We need a program to help individuals who are in such situations, so we can resolve and prevent familial issues and substance abuse issues that arise from these problems and stressors. There are many issues surrounding the misunderstanding and failure to learn about cultures. For example, many families in the hands of the law are being mistreated because authorities are unable to understand them and arrest them unnecessarily. We need more understanding and learning.”    Free Children’s Programs: Tamil community members also advocated for the need for free community programs for children, such as swimming lessons, homework clubs, and afterschool programs. One respondent noted that they used to receive supports from West Neighbourhood House (formerly St. Christopher House) to go sightseeing with their children, but now there are no such opportunities. There are many families in Parkdale that are unable to spend time with their kids due to financial reasons, and these programs would help parents explore the City with their children.","1. Health Care (1)  2. Affordable Housing (1) - focus on tenant rights (2)   1. Education (1) - focus on reopening schools to care for children’s wellbeing (2)     Additional areas: Tighten laws on social distancing, wearing masks, and sanitizing; prioritizing the safety of the community; and supports for transportation. ","Business Loans: Four respondents recommended increasing loans for businesses to support business owners, address issues of bankruptcy, create job opportunities, and stimulate the economy.     Employment Supports: Two respondents recommended creating employment supports to motivate residents to work and to contribute to the economy, including easy jobs for seniors.    Loosen Regulations for Local Businesses: Two respondents recommended loosening regulations in terms of work hours (e.g. working on holidays to make up for lost work) and customer allowances (e.g. allow more people into businesses and restaurants so that they can earn more money and staff can earn more wages).     Adult Education: One respondent recommended making education online or only schedule school in evening or morning to support people who are employed. ",Interpretation and Translation: The majority of the respondents noted that there is a critical need for more interpreters to easily communicate with decision-makers at City Hall. One respondent shared the following:     “We need interpreters because not everyone speaks English fluently and our children cannot always be there to help interpret so this is a big issue. Language barrier is the most important problem we need to fix. We need at least one interpreter per language in a community filled with immigrants.”    City Hotline: Respondents noted that it would be easy if there was a telephone number community members could contact to easily speak with the City of Toronto in different languages and directly share their recommendations with the help of interpreters. They also noted that technical support to access this hotline would be helpful.     Community Meetings: A respondent noted that we need more community meetings so members of the community can share their ideas. ,"Garbage collection (1): Many of the respondents shared the need for better garbage collection and systems for sorting recycling, litter, and compost. The focus was especially on collective responsibility to reduce littering and cleaning up after ourselves.     Active and Public Transportation (2): Several respondents shared the need for improved bike lanes on roads to make cycling more accessible for people. They also advocated for reduced rates for TTC to incentivize people to not use cars:      “The city keeps increasing the cost of the TTC fares and so for the cost of gasoline, people will ride public transit instead of driving their own cars. For example, we need to promote using the TTC by offering discounts so more people will go on the TTC instead of driving their cars and this will lower pollution by a lot. TTC could think about not increasing fares and instead offer discounts to promote ridership.”    Reduce car pollution (2): Several respondents noted that we need to reduce the number of cars on roads to reduce car pollution.     Ban Plastic Bags (2): Several respondents recommended banning plastic bags and using paper bags instead. For example, one respondent shared that they had to explain why plastic bags are poor for the environment at their workplace in a grocery store.     Additional recommendations: Respondents also recommended limiting carbon emissions by imposing a higher carbon tax; reducing construction levels; and reducing smoking, which they referred to as pollution of the environment and the mind. ","Social Distancing, Personal Protection, and Sanitation: Most respondents shared their satisfaction with the emergency public health measures calling for people to stay home, practice social distancing, limiting the amount of people in businesses, and making masks mandatory in public spaces. Respondents were also grateful for increased sanitation in grocery stores (e.g. grocery carts and baskets) and apartment buildings (e.g. elevators and door handles).     Mutual Aid and Grocery Supports: Many respondents shared that Parkdale gave a lot of support to people in delivering groceries to those who were unable to leave their homes. Respondents noted that groups like Parkdale People’s Economy and Mutual Aid Parkdale helped community members get groceries and other household supplies. One respondent shared that The local Tamil store helped by continuing to supply the community with needed groceries and items. Another community member shared that her son gave her a bunch of masks that she redistributed to members of her community.    Online Senior Supports: One respondent shared that they have seniors’ programs on ZOOM through West Neighbourhood House such as yoga and exercises. In a way it is good to have gatherings like this, but there is still a need to be safe and not go out too much.","Public Health Measures: We need to create formal screening systems in public spaces such as public transit, schools, etc. Some people are unable to get masks due to unavailability in stores and so masks need to be handed out freely. When schools reopen, we need better safety measures in place.    Addressing Gun Violence: We need to address gun violence, especially in Parkdale: “If police can implement better strategies to decrease gun violence, I would feel safer in the community.”    Seniors Support: The senior homes in our community need to be safeguarded in better ways especially because they are vulnerable due to old age. We must take care of them and so these senior homes need better safety precautions and regulations. Many seniors are unable to go grocery shopping and we need continued assistance for them at the community level.  Pharmacies and doctors need to be more accessible especially now for those who are sick and the elderly.    Interest Rates: Many banks should decrease their interest rates because many people have gone bankrupt because of high interest rates that have persisted for a long time. Banks need to help patrons with    Support Local Businesses: Many businesses are on the verge of closing and the City needs to provide some financial aid so they should not close. The government needs to step in and help with the financial and economic recovery of businesses.    Food Security Programs We need better food programs for the community to ensure children are eating healthily. Many children eat junk food and this needs to be lessened and we need more healthy food options.     Toronto Community Housing: Community housing needs to be more clean, more safe, more live-able; appliances need to be more durable. Housing needs to be more affordable, we cannot afford rent increases.    Supports for Working Class Communities: Rent keeps increasing. Transit needs to be better; we need more buses to maintain social distancing. ",,,,,

11827205967,16,N/A ,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,"Most, if not all, participants, had difficulties shopping for necessities during the beginning of the pandemic, with some continuing to have these issues today. Many things were out of stock, and the price gouging on essential items was undeniable and had an impact on many households in our group. Shopping for culturally relevant items, such as vegetables and spices, has also proven difficult especially for senior citizens, who need to depend on someone else to bring them these goods. Some participants also found it difficult to access medical supplies, even for pre-existing medical conditions.      All participants spoke on the negative mental health impacts that the pandemic has had on them. The biggest and most common complaints across all ages came from the challenges of staying home. A sedentary lifestyle with limited or no social interactions, a limit on entertainment options, and unhealthy eating habits came up, and all these elements made our participants feel worse about themselves and the COVID-1 situation. Participants also generally felt less motivated about engaging in any type of activities due to social restrictions in place. Major events, like convocations and family events, being postponed has also made it more difficult to cope with social distancing and isolation. However, quarantine’s impacts vary by age group as well, as each age group had different concerns. Youth were stressed with the transition to online school, and felt they did not always have the right resources from their school or their family to support them as they adapted learning styles and tried to keep up. Recent graduates were stressed about their job prospects. Unemployed adults were worried to be home unemployed, and it was a source of distress to think of how to provide for their families with the government support they received. Employed adults noted that despite the resources provided by their workplaces, they have been overwhelmed with either working from home and maintaining a work-life balance, or working in-person and staying safe while on the job. Adults who are also primary caretakers for elderly family members experienced stress from having to help and care for seniors, and assure that they can help them without passing anything onto them. Seniors were impacted due to limited family time, limited resources available to them since the pandemic started, and isolation overall. They fear that if something happens to them, they are unable to access the help they need, whether it be medical, emotional, or social support. They are also aware of their vulnerability to the disease, and fear of contracting COVID-1 has been a major fear for all of them, including some who mistook certain ailments as symptoms of the disease.       On the flip side, some participants also spoke on the mental health benefits that being quarantined has brought them. This includes being able to spend more time with their families, taking advantage of free time to explore new hobbies, using technology to connect with others, and the flexibility of being able to work from home. The technology-based options were more firmly spoken about by our younger participants.      Most youth and middle-aged adults also have worries related to their employment status, and have had their livelihoods be impacted by COVID-1. While those who have lost their jobs in our group also said they were accessing services like EI and CERB, they were still worried about providing for their families. Recent graduates had either lost their previous internship or job opportunities in the wake of the pandemic, or were finding it extremely difficult to find opportunities in a weak job market.      A few participants spoke about the guilt they associate with the privilege of being Canadian, and having access to different services here while their families abroad are suffering from worse conditions. Some also mentioned difficulties with sending money back home to family members, especially in countries where COVID-1 has had a much worse impact than it has here. While living through a pandemic is difficult, they expressed that they have access to many resources that aren’t available elsewhere, but also noted that even in Canada the services and privileges they have are not applicable to all members of their community.   ","Before COVID-1, respondents accessed recreation and community centres, special needs support services, WheelTrans transit services (seniors exclusively), Personal Support Workers (seniors exclusively), online mental health support lines through school and work, and school support networks.","Enhanced communication with the public from the Canadian government are needed by participants in the form of very clear news and instructions, as many mentioned that finding reliable, cohesive news has been difficult. Regular updates from governmental sources regarding COVID-1 with clear directive would help, as there have been many messages such as those about mask use, CERB, etc. that have been unclear and ever-changing, making it hard to keep up with. Along with this comes streamlining communications, and providing resources that have all the information in one place, and can be easily searched and accessed by all. Having these resources also be coordinated with Tamil media outlets would allow for a language barrier to also be addressed, and assure that ALL parts of the Tamil community are receiving reliable information via any medium.  There is a huge gap on culturally relevant and accessible services in the Tamil community. Whether it’s food security or mental health, many do not know where to turn to access services that can effectively serve them. All age groups have been impacted in some way or form negatively by a service that failed to understand the cultural context in which their experience is rooted. Participants also expect reinforcements for more vulnerable populations in our community, notably domestic violence survivors and senior citizens. These services need to not only support, but empower people, and be provided in the correct cultural context.    When it came to entertainment, many hoped for the city to explore ways to start or continue programming in as safe a way as possible. Young participants are finding it especially difficult to stay quarantined at this time, and senior participants spoke on the difficulty of accessing new programming as the services they used to offer have either dramatically decreased or completely ceased. This also brought up the point of accessible telecommunications, as many noted that reliable internet can be expensive and difficult to provide, and should be something the City looks to provide as more programming moves online.   Health services are undeniably needed, both physical and mental. As of now those that do have access to mental health networks can only access them during work if at all, while others have to cope on their own or seek free online resources. Having these resources be available 21/1, and by anyone who may need them in different languages and through different mediums will be essential. Having health care options also be easily accessible, especially for seniors who have many limits being placed on their actions and the resources available to them, will also be of utmost importance going forward.    ","The list of services being accessed by our participants expanded during the pandemic, as participants required much more support. This includes public and private remote health care services (Telehealth Ontario, SeeTheDoctor, etc.), financial supports from the government (CERB, CESB, volunteer grants, rebates/deferrals on utilities), social media support through community and positivity accounts, employer-provided supports (monetary bonuses, their provision of support workers and/or resources, flexible hours, and offering breaks), food bank and delivery services, a wide range of help lines, food banks, support workers, and more.      Online supports need to be rendered more accessible, as right now they need to be navigated by younger, more tech savvy people and are still difficult to access for many others. Convenience also needs to be matched with capacity, as many noted that services like Telehealth, CRA, 11, and others are online and meant to be used easily, but it is almost impossible to actually receive information from them or get a hold of people. A quick transition to online services also ignores the learning curves that many senior citizens face, as they strive to become technologically literate. Reduced hours and in-person services makes it very difficult for those without reliable internet or knowledge to seek the help they need. As such, the City might even consider internet accessibility and literacy initiatives, especially ones in Tamil that can help senior citizens.      Every senior citizen consulted spoke on the inefficiency and unreliability of WheelTrans. This has been an ongoing issue since before COVID-1, and has worsened now. Considering how difficult it even is to secure doctor appointments in this time, it has made it even more difficult for seniors when their transportation either cancels or arrives late, and they lose out on essential medical services.      Mental health needs were also touched on heavily, and many wished for centralized, accessible resources that the city could provide to either fill a gap in their lives now, or supplement the limited ones being offered by their workplaces. Culturally specific resources are also needed in general, as elaborated in a previous answer. Due to language or cultural barriers, services like help lines, grocery delivery, and more become obsolete or even a burden to our most vulnerable populations.      The lack of Tamil representation was noted in our City’s decision makers. While this is not necessarily the ultimate solution to hearing Tamil voices, many stated that they need councillors to do a better job of Tamil-specific and general community outreach. It is always difficult to contact them, and convey what is needed by our community. As councillors with their respective budgets per city, they need to assure they understand our specific needs. Some also noted that the city should not ignore regularly needed maintenance in a time like this where health concerns are so high, such as mowing public lawns to avoid ticks that carry Lyme disease.   ",N/A,N/A,"The main thing noted was Tamil representation at the table, mainly in the form of councillors and city staff. It is frustrating when non-racialized persons represent largely racialized populations, and so even if that is the case there need to be mechanisms to hold them accountable (as this is not the case now). A more direct and responsive line of communication is needed to facilitate this, as currently participants note that it feels like they are communicating into a void. Similarly, young people need to be engaged in decision-making, and be consulted before making decisions that affect their lives.   The city needs to work on culturally sensitive services as well, through hiring people with those lived experiences to engage in the work, expanding services to reflect what the community needs, and engage in culturally relevant and appropriate work. The city has had many mishaps with the even most basic Tamil translations in the past, so culturally relevant services are a much bigger and more important ask here. The city also needs to diversify the mediums through which it provides information, and should actively work with racialized media to convey their messages. For many without internet access or knowledge, this is an easy way to convey relevant, culturally relatable content that is also from a reliable source.   The City should also understand that accessibility does not equal online, especially when so many do not have reliable internet nor are they always technologically literate. While online programming is great and appreciated, the city needs to dig deeper on an infrastructure level, and consider what they can do to promote internet access and trainings to their citizens at large, as a lack of support here affects everyone from students trying to keep up with online school, adults seeking reliable news, to seniors trying to access services.   ",N/A,"Stores like Costco and others distributed masks for customers, and it would be great if this could be expanded to public spaces as well. The safety measures in place for front line workers at retail/grocery stores was also noted by participants. Employees noted how accommodating and flexible their workplaces have been since quarantine began, and highlighted acts such as bonuses, subsidies, and other perks their employers now offered them.. There has been much initiative taken by ordinary community members without the obligation of the government, including people checking in on elderly neighbours, teachers organizing drive-bys, virtual entertainment activities organized by schools, community organizations, and families, and more. One participant referred to the South Korean response to COVID-1 as a model to follow.  ","A hotline or phone line to access city councillors would be helpful, as would frequent town halls, and for councillors to PROACTIVELY consult citizens themselves. Many participants believe that the city itself should be engaging in this kind of consultation work, and were surprised to understand that we were not acting directly on behalf of the city, but rather to advocate on their behalf to the city.

Overall put more funding into technological jobs and supports for individuals to obtain trades in that field since the future is going virtual. There are many individuals during COVID-1 that do not understand how to use computers. The government can support small businesses by providing funding that will support them with needed resources and grants that they will not have to pay back.

Parents are deeply concerned about schools reopening however in order for many of them to ensure that they can return to work they are expressing and needs to have to strategic collaborative planning with school boards and daycares to ensure that their children are safe while they are at work.  ,Sending children back to school as well as you is a difficult thought too many parents are concerned about health risk.    The virtual services that took place from March to June we're very difficult and strenuous for parents especially with those with young children as they require one-on-one attention as well as plenty of outdoor time.    Parents have voiced that these Services can be strengthened by offering one-on-one tutoring support for children at specified time even for at least one hour a day. If the board could have put together a tutoring plan for children that would make it easier rather than having parents sought out tutors on their own who are often very costly.    The technology provided by the school board was very difficult to use as it was not permitted for apps or other accounts to be opened on these devices.    Employment Readiness programs are now being offered online which many are finding convenient as it is allowing them to get support with resume writing remotely as well as preparing themselves to become a gainfully employed once in pandemic has ended.    Students have voice that based on their course they actually prefer online learning as it is enabled them to save on Transportation time and they have more time to spend on their studies.    Transportation is an issue as a lot of the area here is under construction.It would be great to have faster construction being done Eglinton to make it safer for walking and getting the bus.  ,   1. Opening daycares and schools in a safe manner. Mitigate the risk of children Contracting covid-1.  Assisting parents with tutoring educational support to ensure that no child gets left behind.  Assisting parents with food supports as children are eating more food than ever being at home     Creating financial support services to assist families who are unable to work or gain income due to covid-1 and score and daycare is not operating at full capacity.     2. Ensuring long-term care homes are adequately staff and are following safety protocols. Too many elders had their lives put at risk and died because of poor procedure taking place in long-term care homes.     Seniors also need support with getting access to medicines as some delivery services have been overwhelmed and are difficult to obtain.  1. There should be more support for small business owners by providing further grants for startups to overcome some of the harsh lending criteria that are currently happening to the covid-1.    Running a small business has been more difficult than ever unless you have services that can be transferable to eCommerce.  They should be more grants and funding for those who have low income and are looking to pursue entrepreneurship.    Many people are at home and would like to return to work however do not have the option of doing stuff. The ending of serve happening in October is bringing anxiety too many people who do not have employment lined up. The rated social services Ontario Works provide is not adequate in order to support a family. As such many people would much rather pursue entrepreneurship in order create finances On Their Own merit.      ,It is important to stimulate the economy right now by supporting those who are looking to so work. There are many subsidies for employers to hire youth the very little that support adults at the same capacity.    More support for having adult Learners find jobs that are subsidized for at least three to four months would be a significant start.    Supporting small-business owners so that they can start up and hire people with incentive would be a great support as there are many new entrepreneurs looking to get started.    The federal government needs to focus on making a fair deal to ensure that parents can focus on getting back to work once their children are properly being educated.  ,It is important that the city understands that while engaging residence it is difficult for residents to feel that their voices are being heard if actions are not taken. There are far too many reports that the city has conducted Consulting communities which only end up as a pretty report which either stays on someone's death or gets published online somewhere.    Creating tangible action plans that are resource base is essential to ensure that residents are not wasting their time when they are providing their input.    It would be ideal to have residence on  City boards however they should not be tokenized their involvement should be meaningful and their opinions should be deeply values based on lived experience     ,   Local Urban farming is tremendously underutilized in the city of Toronto. There are plenty of green spaces that are being underused and couldn't support families and communities with fresh local food. Rather than importing the local food movement can be taking place within communities with high food insecurity rate this would reduce Greenhouse emissions by not trucking in tons of food across the border.     Making a greater effort to ensure that people know how to properly sort their garbage.     And has thing the waste diversion system at the City by ensuring that black Plastics and other materials that can be recycled can be processed properly.     ,As local residents and communities come together to support those who are food insecure with a food distribution service that is helping families making ends meet.    We Are partnering with local Partners such as who cares Toronto and Second Harvest to Sure. Families have access to Fresh local food.    We are also ensuring that vulnerable tenants are being serviced by going door-to-door to connect your people and find out what their needs are.  ,I have had other conversations with concerned residents and vulnerable people since the pandemic and I'm hearing that they would like to have a lot more transparency in opportunities that are coming through the city. I have heard many people say that they did not know certain programs existed I think it is imperative for more communication to be transferred into community Through resident engagement resident leaders and local Community Partners. There should also be some evaluation on how effective local partners are in disseminating information to community as having a lack of communication can come to the detriment of many residents. ,,,,,

Also I would like to say that there is no jobs in Toronto currently and people are really having a hard time and struggling to make a living. 1% of the people are having mental stress right now. Please make CERB  a basic Universal income to come out of poverty in Canada.   -	Government should increase benefits of ODSP people. Rent is high, grocery bills gone high .

He was sleeping outside – he wasn’t being respected in hospitals.    I started binging on junk food. TTC are now diligent about masks. Only so many things you can do. Line ups for stores has been difficult.     My finances are depleted, and it's harder to find work as many are looking, health wise I had to quarantine for 1 days as may have had COVID. On a good note I have been busier than ever during COVID whether applying for work, doing zoom meetings, support systems online.     Over the last number of years I have been learning skills, which have helped me get through COVID. I have a friend whose mother contracted COVID and died. I have been trying to stay positive, show people that I can do something for somebody.    Life is not more different than it was, I am home and gaming. This could go on for some time.     ","I had supports for alcohol addiction, but did relapse during the pandemic. I was part of Toronto employment services subcommittee and offered 10$ honourarium. It’s hard to go from in person to zoom meetings, doing everything on zoom. I was having about 1 zoom meetings a week and am now doing 1.    I went to the library regularly and enjoyed that, and got passes through my library card, to go to the ROM and AGO. I miss that. That’s hit me the hardest. The passes were free with your card. There was a lot happening in the city in general. All passes have been null. This is hard when on an ODSP budget.   I have accessed a food bank once in a while, I have certain dietary needs.     I have ordered out, as had accessed CERB – and bought furniture I needed. I am making my home a better fort for the long haul under the pandemic.    I saw a therapist at ** twice a week sometimes, that’s an in person. I coulf bounce everything off her.   I am seeing doctors online, to get an Rx online for medical marihuana.   Dentist appointment – had to wait a long time.  Services are slower, I need AC as it has been very hot. There’s a lot of confusion re getting air conditioners as an AC unit fell last year. I don’t go out very much. The ** where I work is more active than at home.    Our group used to meet in person and now have to do meetings on ZOOM, which is a challenge. One member can’t do video calling and has to dial in. It is hard to attract new members as we don’t meet people since COVID started.    One person said they are fine with online addiction supports. One member has a back yard in his rental building but finds it very hard to live in one room, it’s like living in a jail cell – especially during COVID.    My sleeping patterns have been affected by COVID. I must pick up sleeping pills, and am still struggling with sleep.   ","Keep the CERB coming. Raise the rates for ODSP and OW in line with CERB – to $2,000 a month.    One member has worked at isolation centres, all of this work is up and down and he does not have consistent employment.     You have to jump through too many hoops to rely on income supports. I have had to be self sufficient with work. Others are having a really hard time accessing supports, and dealing with attitudes.    There are peers who worked at isolation sites who won’t take CERB as they don’t trust the government.    Government needs to keep supplying CERB to support people.   Employment status is affected – my worker is allowing me to get ODSP. Getting my benefits. Others can’t get them.     I get orthotics; my order got screwed up, during COVID I had to get reassessed. Restrictions to orthotics and dental work – ODSP has to step up. Orthotics got really delayed and messed up. Paper was not ok’d in time when should have been. Often I have to go in person to follow up; can’t do online only appointments with ODSP worker. Had to go three times in person.   ","There must be one system that relies on each level of government as a whole. All three levels must line up and provide an umbrella of all services.   We must have 21 per cent deeply subsidized housing units in all new housing buildings that developers put in place.   There can’t be foreign investment ie with Air BnB and nobody local was responsible for it. We need more subsidized housing; One member is stuck in a small room during COVID.  Democracy is under threat. Premier Ford is not doing enough regarding the long term care homes. Release the funds from taxes. They sent in the military to care homes. We must care for our frail seniors.  There will be a lot of data showing that we are paying a lot for emergency services. We want those numbers written down and compare the numbers to infrastructure for housing and health care. ** Put the money into controlled health care and housing.  Many older people had union jobs and are well cared for. We need job security. Companies are downsizing.   We must have taxes raised on the very wealthy. They keep way too much of their money.    There are 11,000 people waiting for affordable housing in Toronto. This is the number one issue. Housing gives people dignity. There must be accountability.  Decriminalization of drugs is a top priority, as overdoses during COVID are up.   The provincial ban on evictions will be lifted. Different legal clinics have been cut back and defunded. People will need legal help. Someone must show support for people. An ombudsman needed.   Must raise the minimum wage – people need $21 an hour to live in Toronto.  Inflation is hitting again. Must raise the standard of living generally. Our rent is going up.   ",New affordable housing for all must be top priority.  Get the city to push for a living wage at the provincial level.  Push for food and nutrition funding.  All people on social assistance need to be paid the amount people get on the CERB – that is needed to get by in Toronto.  ,"Create COVID positions – every company and NGO should be doing this.  We need more peer work, employing people with lived experience. There must be supports through the charitable non-profit sector. They can provide services that are lacking. Provide more safe injection sites 21 hours a day across the city.  ","Reach out to groups like ours. The mayor should be on our calls, as we did a zoom call with Councillor Mike Layton. Come to us, don’t always expect us to hunt you down.",We need to have a low income transit pass that people on low incomes can access for free.,"Our social action group of people with lived experience has  moved online, and we have invited politicians to meet with us. We can do this through zoom. TESS has also done this; there is lots of well versed diversity within the TESS group. Fred Victor has been offering board of director positions for people with lived experience. Organizations need to bring in more lived experience and the city should do this too. People with lived experience need honourarium to participate in things, including when groups are online.",You need a little mini United Nations from different constituencies and have them get together and talk at the city level.

There is news that many on social assistance and ODSP are allowed to take CERB. This makes low-income workers feel unhappy that they work and still earn less than someone on social assistance earns.

Everyone feels depression and anxiety due to low incomes, unemployment, and overloading in-home chores, cleaning, sanitizing, and long hours waiting for groceries shopping. For example, a participant was working with ** for almost over a year but due to the COVID-1, she lost her job, and feel unexpected anxiety caused by high rent payment and low incomes for family expenses. Besides that, a participant son also lost his job due to COVID-1, which definitely affected his family for low income and the creation of financial constraints. Besides all the above, since the whole participants’ family and friends are living in ** and some affected by COVID-1, thus it also created extra anxiety for the loss of their beloved ones in ** here in Canada.     During the quarantine and COVID-1, participants have not reported domestic violence, but for sure they shared their experiences about intense pressure on their multiple burdens for home chores, cleaning, sanitizing, and long-standing for groceries lineups, a smaller number of counters, and in some cases discriminatory behaviors. For instance, a participant wearing a headscarf and said, “One day when I was outside for my personal stuff, a white woman told me this pandemic is only because of you guys.” In another case, a participant said, “I was in the lineup to the entrance of Cherry Garden, but someone verbally attacked me, however, I was considering the social distance and wearing a mask.” another participant of this survey also faced almost the same kind of discrimination in a supermarket and she shared her worries about the situation and said, “it seems like people are living in shocking and at any possible ways trying to behave in discriminatory ways with hateful expressions.”    The survey participants did not report about the available threat to get out of their dwell by property owners, however, they shared their concerns from the increase of rent from 1% to 21% his year. They discussed the disproportionate relations between the increase of rent payments and minimum wages and its negative effect on social and economic aspects. Because before and during the pandemic unemployment and low income have been remained a big concern at the country level. ","Majority of services listed above where provide to the participants.   However the Wellness Café group before pandemic planned to conduct an Afghan traditional exhibition to display works of arts in clothes, cooking, and traditional values in order to engage positively in Toronto's multicultural city. But unluckily it canceled due to quarantine and the COVID-1 bans.  Participants’ informed from the availability of diverse types of supports before the COVID—1, such as skill supports for employment, small-business support, public libraries and many more…… however it limited during the pandemic and the situation get hard to access public services in different offices due to the minor number of staff and busy phone helplines. In tax filling, for example, participants’ have been facing to find places and volunteers for this year's tax filing, and when they find a community so they mostly waiting for long hours in phone calls. Besides that, some participants were illustrating the slow paper works of IRCC as well.   During epidemic services that increased than before are in senior support, food, security, and mental health and access to technology for virtual meetings, conferences, and learning purposes. For instance, using Zoom App and maybe many others.   ","-	Immigration paper works must re-arrange to the normal turn as before the epidemic.   -	The government helplines are not adequate to respond to clients and providing services, thus it needs to speed up through hiring more staff and expanding helplines services. It could decrease the unemployment rate and promote economy during the pandemic and lastly will diminish the COVID-1 vires spreading at the country level. Overall, the increase of online jobs will help the nation in social and economic aspects and promote a more healthy and safe space.    -	One of the participants said, “Overall services are going very slow. For example, people have money but couldn’t proceed with it for business purposes.” She added in another case, workers for example in construction workers are intensively busy and they might face health issue and they may need health support during work, but they could not access it because all medical staff is busy with COVID—1 patients.    ","All participants were unsatisfied with the performance of organizations for finding jobs, such as YMCA, Skills for Change, etc. They specifically pointed out two challenges within these organizations: The organizations’ staff capacity is not at the level to work and find a job for people in different professions (participants are not satisfied with only resume writing training). They mentioned organizations technically could not provide effective support for their clients in terms of findings jobs and introducing them into related agencies. For example, a participant has filled her resume in the YMCA for finding a job, but finally, after over a year she finds a job by herself.    The survey participants recommend bringing reforms and rearranging these organizations’ platforms for better services. ","Participants suggest financial supports should be discussed between the city, provincial, and federal levels in order to provide better solutions for unemployment and supporting small businesses to promote the economy. ","The government should provide grants instead of loans and link the small businesses with the communities in order to support the poor.   Big businesses should protect small businesses. And these supports should be designed for the longer term in order to build economy. And the economy should not be in competitive mode, instead, it should be turned to the supportive mode.   The peoples’ voices always should be heard, and the government should go ahead accordingly. For this purpose, the consultation process from the people should be expanded and it should not be relying only on surveys. The participants brought an example of government support for individuals which is temporary, not enough, and creates dependency. instead, long-term skills training for low-income families should be planned. ","All, appreciate this consultation and the opportunity for provided to share our voice at the city and country levels to decisions making for a decent life for all. They also suggested continuing the dialogue between community and decision-makers at the city hall on thematic topics.","Participants had the three following recommendations:  -	To achieve this particular goal, participants suggest the old cars must be collected and destroyed.   -	Using bike should be advocated widely  -	Bike share for low-income community members should be free.   ","However, with the current pandemic, all people affected badly due to low income, unemployment, and family expenses and many other problems including loss of their relatives as mentioned above.  However, we (Women's Wellness Café) tried to treat at least our group positively through spiritual healing practices. For this purpose, specifically, in the first month of quarantine, we regularly divided the 1 chapters of the Holy Quran among the group members to recite. Further, we continued our virtual online weekly group meetings to share the COVID-1 experience,  and check-in in order to overcome the problems. Moreover, we held a number of women’s cycling network virtual meetings for the cyclist women of our group and attended to the distribution of donating bikes and the Bike match initiative to support a healthy life.

","To ensure that our community can easily share our concerns, ideas and solution with decision-makers at City Hall, the city should implement Community Input platform and process such as on-line input portal, surveys, focus groups or advisory / consultative committee that is inclusive and fair representative from all groups of population including marginalized groups.  Decision-makers at City Hall also need to allow / consider the Community Input in their decision-making process.","To support our community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be better prepared to face the impacts of climate change, the City, other levels of government, community partners and organizations need to do the followings:  -	Enabling more programs, services to be available and accessible online or virtually, by doing so, there will be less people who will need to travel to the physical locations to access the services or programs, less travel, less greenhouse gas emissions.  -	Implementing ‘working from home’ policy for employees to have options to work from home using the technology.

There are several grass roots groups that would be very helpful in reaching out to the marginalized groups and encourage them to attend and provide their ideas and concerns. Meetings should be made accessible in terms of locations, timings, and supports like childminding etc. This will enhance and increase the participation of groups from whom we never hear about their concerns.","There are several ways that residents can be educated on using energy more wisely. There can be regular events and meetings focused on talking about climate change and how the residents have the power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging residents to reduce, recycle, reuse. Educate residents on creative ways to recycle, reduce and reuse. Explaining the benefits of lessening their household waste and disposing it in the right way can save everyone from the harmful effects of climate change.  Also offering incentives like deposits for glass bottles and jars and cans and plastics   Schools can also play a vital role in educating students at all levels. This should be incorporated in the daily school routine; there could be prizes and incentives for children who come up with and demonstrate that they are climate action champions in their classes and encourage them to educate their parents to be more energy efficient. Local organizations and grassroots groups can also help spread the word through fun activities, fun-fairs and workshops, sewathons, repairathons and neighbourhood swaps. ","When the COVID- 1 hit our city, the residents came together and made over 10 masks for the local hospital to give out to the people who visit the hospital. This meant a concerted effort where the whole community and beyond came together; people donated materials, elastic, thread, sewing machines and residents who know how to sew gave their time to sew facemasks and people who did not know how to sew gave their time to cut the fabric in to the right size, some made deliveries and pick ups.  People donated to the local foodbanks and organizations to keep them well stocked so that people in need could survive during these difficult time.","Ans. The health and safety of the residents should be the top priority for the city, this includes things like rules and conditions aimed at reducing the spread of the COVID-1 virus. Everyone, including individuals, employers and businesses, must follow the orders issued by public health.  While a number of businesses that were required to close initially, and most businesses were required to cease admitting patrons were permitted to sell online or over the phone and arrange delivery or pick-up of purchases. Door-to-door soliciting was also prohibited but delivery was permitted.  The Government has to continue to follow trend of the virus closely and continue with the phased recovery plan that it introduced to ensure that businesses and organizations can resume their activities in a rapid yet safe manner. Progress across all phases should be monitored closely to ensure the health and safety of residents and to limit the resurgence of COVID-1 transmission within the city.  City run facilities like parks, recreation centres, libraries etc if opened, must be kept clean, sanitized and maintain the regulations and guidelines set out by Toronto Public Health to ensure the safety of their employees as well as the residents.  Throughout all the phases, as we progress towards a “new normal” for Toronto, it is critical that everyone observes the public health measures and restrictions to help protect our communities and loved ones.
